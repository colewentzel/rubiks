# **Rubik's Cube Solving Guide**

My goal for this project was to create a resource explaining how to solve a Rubik's Cube that is simple to follow, concise, and informative. This guide was written by me using my own knowledge on solving the puzzle in order to teach club members at my local Boys and Girls club how to approach a Rubik's Cube. I included graphics and photos in order to explain all possible scenarios and how to solve them.
