# **Rubik's Cube Solving Guide**

This guide was a part of a program I designed for my local Boys and Girls Club in order to help introduce club members to algorithms and other computing concepts.

My goal for this project was to create a resource explaining how to solve a Rubik's Cube that is simple to follow, concise, and informative. This guide was written by me using my own knowledge on solving the puzzle. I included graphics and photos in order to explain all possible scenarios and how to solve them.
